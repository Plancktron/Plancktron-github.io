Hello world! This is my first time using Git, hope it'll be fun. :)
This line was written on second-branch as a tutorial on pushing on Git.

### Notes for Linux ###
1. /local/ means you have it installed not via package manager, so to uninstall it you have to provide the full path:
  1. Do ./.local/bin/pip3.6 uninstall pip instead of pip3.6 uninstall pip
2. Installation of python pip:
  1. Use ensurepip if you have permission to the system. Otherwise, download from bootstrap.pypa.io. Use the latest get-pip.py. Run python get-pip.py.
