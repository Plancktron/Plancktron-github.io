Hello world! This is my first time using Git, hope it'll be fun. :)
This line was written on second-branch as a tutorial on pushing on Git.

### Notes for Linux ###
1. /local/ means you have it installed not via package manager, so to uninstall it you have to provide the full path:
    1. Do ./.local/bin/pip3.6 uninstall pip instead of pip3.6 uninstall pip
2. To load Python in NSCC ASPIRE2A system (an HPC), use module avail python to check the versions available first. Then run module load python/xx.xx.xx to load the python modulefile. Check the Python version using python --version. Pip package manager should come together with the corresponding Python version.
3. When trying to do tab-completion on the CLI with environment variables, for example vim $PWD/file, do CTRL+ALT+E to expand $PWD rather than press tab.
